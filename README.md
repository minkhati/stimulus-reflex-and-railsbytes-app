# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* After creating Rails application if you give `rails -T`, it will give you all the webpacker command to install particular gem
* So you can install for example stimulus using webpacker as
`rails webpacker install:stimulus`
* Or using bundle add as
`bundle add stimulus_reflex`
* After bundle you can install it as
`rails stimulus_reflex:install`
